# IoT-based Biogas Plant Health Monitoring
 
## EE-344 : Electronics Design Lab

- *An IoT-based monitoring system for a biogas plant that measures and displays parameters such as gas concentrations, humidity, and temperature* 

- *The design consists of a tailor-made custom in-house designed two-layer printed circuit board interfacing gas sensors in a modular fashion using I2C*

- *The data is sent to a central server and stored in a cloud database for remote access and analysis through a web application. The system helps optimize biogas production, identify issues, improve safety, and offers flexibility to integrate additional gas sensors. Furthermore, we successfully addressed anticipated problems during development and prototyping stages and submitted a complete market-ready product*
